# OG-Code

OG-Code (Open G-Code) is a utility for working with G-code (Geometry
Code) and has a focus on interoperability with the OpenGalvo (OPAL)
project for laser engraving.

Combined, OpenGalvo and OG-Code provide a complete, end-to-end,
open-source software solution for controlling laser engravers and
cutters using galvanometer scan heads that support the XY2-100
protocol.

Thanks to Les Wright of YouTube channel "Les\' Lab" for inspiration
and advice. Les also provides an open source PCB design customized to
work with OpenGalvo.
